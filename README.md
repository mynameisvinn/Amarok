amarok is a bare bones library for association mining. association mining is often used to identify assocations (correlations, not causation) between items in a set.

### computing lift with bayes
association mining calculates lift. lift is equal to *confidence* (defined as p(y|x)) divided by *support* (p(y), which is the probability of seeing y in the entire population). (we could also compute lift as the joint probability p(y, x) divided by p(x).)

for example, imagine that 60% of our customers buy eggs (p(y) = 60%). meanwhile, customers who buy bacon have a 80% chance of buying eggs (p(y|x) = 80%). the lift generated by bacon is 1.3x. as a retailer, we might consider offering discounts on bacon to increase egg sales.
